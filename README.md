## Microsoft-Word-Table-Importer

This VBA code automatically imports the content of all tables from a Word (.docx) or RTF file into Excel, replicating the original tables' structure, content, and formatting. It is primarily used to convert financial statements provided by our accounting firmâ€”from Word format to a more manageable Excel format for further analysis.

The script is linked to a custom button in Excel through the creation of an Excel Add-in. By clicking the button, the user can select the Word file, after which the code iterates through all tables in the document and replicates their content in Excel, enabling much faster analysis and verification.
